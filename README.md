# The Countdown
A 21st Century Highschool Bell (www.homeoftheleopards.com) 

*Website still used by highschool but managed by other people now*

## Summary
A big problem in my high school was that nobody knew when class finished or started because my high school doesnâ€™t have a bell. 
The website I made is simple and elegant, with just the click of a button
everything would be figured out for you including the type of schedule being used today ('cause my school has several), what class you are in currently, how long for that class to end and the next class or break/lunch to begin. 
Now if you had a free block and were studying in the library, you would know when it's time to go to your next class instead of speculating and ending up late.
It was one of those things that students and teachers fell in love with instantly. 

**It was great to see everyone's laptop open to a countdown of when Chemistry class would end!**
